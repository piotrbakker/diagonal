Instead, the company provides guidance through its Wear OS design documentation, which defines five screen density breakpoints: Extra-Small (192dp), Small (204dp), Medium (216dp), Large (225dp), and Extra-Large (240dp). Additionally, Android Studio offers two Wear OS virtual device templates: Small Round (384×384px) and Large Round (454×454px).
